# ColdStack

ColdStack is the first Decentralized Storage Aggregator, using AI technology to find the best storage prices from services like Filecoin an Arweave.



## 1. About ColdStack

ColdStack is a unified protocol which allows for the aggregation of Decentralized Storage Networks (DSNs) such as Filecoin, Sia, and Arweave. Coldstack enables the easy use of these platforms without significant integration efforts, regardless of an individual’s familiarity with DSNs. ColdStack offers a single-entry point to any DSN, optimizing the final costs for consumers with our AI-based pipeline. Much like how Uber supplies its clients with convenient rides from a pool of drivers, or 1inch sources liquidity from an number of exchanges, ColdStack supplies its users with the easiest and most cost-effective way to access storage space from any decentralized cloud.



## 2. Key Highlights

1. Decentralized storage aggregation – finds the best prices for services like Filecoin and Sia.

2. First to market decentralized storage aggregator – there is nothing else on the market like ColdStack currently!

3. $CLS tokens are needed to pay for storage on the platform.

4. Our ease-of-use features such as S3 SDK compatibility make ColdStack usable for businesses and organizations outside of cryptocurrency, and encourages DSN adoption.

5. ColdStack can offer lower costs for almost any blockchain project – centralized and decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, DeFi Games. All these projects have tons of data to store.

6. We do not compete with other decentralized storages - we aggregate them.
