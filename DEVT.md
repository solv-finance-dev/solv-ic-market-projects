# DeHorizon

DeHorizon is aming to create a virtual carnival open to all metaverse inhabitants across multiple chains, that lets players enjoy a second life.



## 1. About DeHorizon

The rise of GameFi and NFTs move us close to realizing the promise of the metaverse. Despite the enthusiastic adoption of these technologies, the current marketplace still lacks a fully-formed metaverse game ecosystem to connect and support a variety of blockchain-based games across multiple chains. A metaverse game ecosystem is essential to make GameFi and NFTs reach their full potential. This is where DeHorizon comes.

Welcome to DeHorizon metaverse!



## 2. Key Highlights

DAO Governance Model

The real metaverse should be built in line with Web 3.0 principles, enabling players to own digital assets and control their blockchain-based data. In conformity with Web 3.0 principles, DeHorizon metaverse will be governed by our DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). The rules and governance of the DAO are coded into smart contracts on the blockchain and cannot be modified unless the DAO community votes to make changes. A community-driven metaverse is what we are building.

 

**DeVerse**

DeVerse is a team battle game. In DeVerse, each player needs a Numen and a point card to battle and earn. Each Numen represents a character in DeVerse and has 1 normal attack and 3 skills.

**DeTournament**

DeTournament is a Battle Royale game. In DeTournament, each player can play alone or with friends, explore unknown treasures and much more. Off-court players can observe the game in God mode.

 

**DeQuidditch**

DeQuidditch is a fantasy sports game involving dragon-riding. The object of the game is to score more points than your opponents. Each goal is worth 5 points and catching the "Magic Ball" is worth 50 points. Each point is also worth an equal number of tokens (in-game currency). The game ends when the “Magic Ball” is captured, or the last one remains on the field. There's no penalty rule during the game. Dragons can fight each other and shoot each other down. Players in each game are limited. If players don't get the chance to play or don't own a dragon, they can place a bet on the players instead and win rewards after the game has ended.
