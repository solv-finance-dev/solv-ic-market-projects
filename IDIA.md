# Impossible Finance IDIA Token

IDIA token is the governance and access token for deal flow allocation from the multichain, decentralized incubator and launchpad.



## 1. About **IDIA Token**

In 2020, Decentralized Finance (defi) saw an explosion of money legos supplanting traditional finance products. With defi being open-source, the holy grail of defi is to aggregate liquidity and talent together, not build in isolation. At Impossible Finance, we bring together investors, users, and projects into a cohesive multi-chain ecosystem. Despite tenures at centralized exchanges, our contributors believe that defi’s composability will power the best project launches, hence the Impossible Incubator and Launchpad. By employing a builder-first model, we focus on launching top teams to ensure quality deal flow for investors and individual users alike. To level the playing field by building a more accessible financial system, we introduce the Impossible Economy: IF Governance (IF) and Impossible Decentralised Incubator Access (IDIA) tokens for fair access into project launches. Finally, to support the liquidity of projects, we offer the Impossible Swap: a multi-purpose dex supporting initial launch sales and secondary markets for any asset. In doing so, we simultaneously create crowdfunding tools to bootstrap blockchain projects in a safe, fair and open manner for builders, as well as better positive-sum opportunities for investors and projects alike. This brings us to what we’re trying to build today. End users shouldn’t even need to know how defi works or what chain it is on - just like how emails can be sent from Yahoo to Gmail, or you can call others on different phone networks; it should just work. As defi power users, we’ve absorbed lessons across crypto, and today, it’s time for us to graduate from our centralised institutions and build the “Impossible”.
