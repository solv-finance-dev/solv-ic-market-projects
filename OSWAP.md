# Openswap

OpenSwap is an integrated one-stop DeFi Hub that currently features a DEX aggregator, Spot Price Liquidity Queues, and Hybrid Smart Routing, helping users find the best on-chain swap options. Coming soon will be the introduction of an anti-rugpull offering called Restricted Group Queues and a new decentralized Interchain Bridging Protocol that will revolutionize on-chain liquidity.



## 1. About Openswap

As the DeFi universe continues to expand, liquidity becomes increasingly scattered across multiple chains and the situation is poised to get worse as new chains emerge with individual DEXs on each chain. Committed to becoming the most comprehensive one-stop DeFi hub offering the best on-chain pricing and multi-chain arbitrage ad trading, OpenSwap allows users to experience revolutionary benefits through optimizing their DEX aggregated trades with OpenSwap’s unique features: Liquidity Queues, Hybrid Smart Router, and Open Interchain Protocol, all on one platform.

Carrying assets swaps or simply transferring digital assets across different chains is inefficient and cumbersome. We understand that multi-chain is here to stay, and we aim to revolutionize and unlock the boundaries of chain-specific digital assets so that liquidity can be efficiently leveraged across different chains.



## 2. Key Highlights

OpenSwap will help give traders and liquidity providers an edge in the ever-changing DeFi space through the following features:

- DEX Aggregator: OpenSwap provides incredible prices and minimized slippage to users through aggregating liquidity from an increasing number of sources, unlike other exchanges that use only a single source of liquidity.

- Liquidity Queues: As a complement to AMM swaps, OpenSwap Liquidity Queues offers spot market trades based on our Secure Adaptor Protocol which carries out trade-time security checks on underlying oracles.

- Hybrid Smart Router: OpenSwap’s Hybrid Smart Router takes the liquidity queues to the next level by enabling the coupling of swap trades from AMM pools with Queues to provide a clear advantage over existing AMM pool-only approaches.

- Open Interchain Protocol: The OpenSwap Interchain Protocol will introduce a solution that offers more efficient inter-blockchain swapping of chain-native digital assets through the usage of single-asset vaults and decentralized mechanisms.
