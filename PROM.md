## 1. About Prometeus Labs

Prometeus is a secure and decentralized protocol that allows fully trustless and anonymous data exchange and storage. Prometeus is layer two, so it can be implemented by the majority of existing blockchains. Our primary goal is to utilize the public blockchain to achieve a decentralized, trustless, and censorship-resistant framework for exchange/share data across various fields and implementations. Our current implementations include data trading/sharing marketplace and firewall resistant social media solutions.
