# PARSIQ

PARSIQ is a next-generation blockchain analytics platform built to connect blockchain activity to off-chain applications and devices.



## 1. About PARSIQ

PARSIQ is a middleware connectivity layer between on-chain and off-chain systems. We run our own nodes, embed our trackers and tracers in the source code, and enable our users to write conditional scripts to monitor transactions and events and create data streams delivered to off-chain systems. We like to call our scripts smart triggers, which effectively is IFTTT for blockchain. Our triggers also allow for data enrichment via integration with third party datasets like Chainlink, Aave, Balancer, Ocean protocol, Uppsala Security, Bitfury Crystal, and others.



## 2. Key Highlights

PARSIQ is designed all around our Smart-Triggers. Users will receive conditioned data in Real Time allowing them to create automated workflows that responds to events. Smart Triggers are currently deployable on Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dash, Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi Eco Chain, Solana & Polkadot Chains.

Parsiq created their own Domain-specific language, ParsiQL, which serves the main purpose of manipulating streams, Saving developers time by being able to reduce coding demands.

The upcoming launch of PARSIQs brand new Tokenomics model, paired with the IQ Protocol is a brand-new model which allows service to unlock when token criteria is met, revolutionizing Service as a Subscription (SaaS) on blockchain.

PARSIQ has been involved in aiding projects post hack/exploit and offers Forensics and ‘snapshot’ technology of both current holders and pool positions. Examples of this are Kucoin, Coinmetro and PAID Hacks.
