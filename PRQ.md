# PARSIQ

Blockchain Monitoring and Workflow Automation Platform.



## 1.About PARSIQ

PARSIQ will automate workflows that you currently handle manually and aggregate data that you look up from different sources. 

It is not only capable of monitoring blockchain transactions, but also enriching them with off-chain data like fiat rate and a risk score. Users can transform and aggregate the data for it to be delivered to their off-chain application of choice. 

We not only have direct integrations for most blockchains, but thanks to the wide range of supported communication channels, we can easily connect to almost any web service, allowing you to bridge automation between blockchain and off-chain. All without writing a single line of code.
