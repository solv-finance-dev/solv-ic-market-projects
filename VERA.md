# VERA

Vera is the most powerful open financial platform for non-fungible token (NFT) assets. Vera offers decentralized financing, leasing, lending, and other essential financial services for any NFT marketplace, game, or application. 

Today, if you want to buy an NFT on a marketplace or game, you must pay the full price in crypto and there are no financing options. Also, credit cards do not support direct NFT purchases due to the risk of theft from chargebacks and refunds. 

Once you own an NFT, you are limited to selling the NFT to generate income—that is if you are even able to find a buyer in the increasingly crowded NFT marketplaces. These limitations and problems cause poor user experiences and slows down the innovation and mass adoption of NFTs. 

Vera solves these challenges and supports NFTs minted on any blockchain, building the foundation for an ecosystem that serves as the gateway that connects real-world assets to the digital world.

Please join the Vera community Discord server; the Vera team and members look forward to helping you understand and use Vera.
